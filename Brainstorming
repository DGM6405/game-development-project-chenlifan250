Idea 1: Running MOBA

Objective: running to the destination as soon as possible.
Obstacles: hill, water, etc.  
Different characters have unique abilities, such as Going across obstacles fast, slowing down others. 

Advance ideas: 
1.	Make it a MOBA. A game has some quarters. At the end of each quarter, players can earn some money, which player can purchase items with. Different items have different promotion: speed up, help go across obstacles, slow down others.

2.	More Modes: Team mode. 3 vs 3 or 2 vs 2. The whole team will win whose member get 1st position. In team mode, not all the players need to run fast, but assist their team members or slow down opponents.
